## What you’ll find here

This repository is designed as a **single hub** for practical, exam-aligned, real-world Azure ML + AI Foundry work:

### Classic ML + MLOps (DP-100-aligned)
- Training & evaluation notebooks (regression/classification)
- Custom environments and reproducible runs
- Hyperparameter tuning
- MLflow tracking + model registry patterns
- Pipelines (training → scoring → evaluation)
- Deployment endpoints (managed online endpoints / batch patterns)
- Model artifacts & run outputs (where appropriate)

### Responsible AI + governance
- Responsible AI dashboards (model explanations, error analysis, fairness)
- Reproducible evaluation patterns and reporting
- Notes on common pitfalls & interpretation tips

### Privacy engineering
- Privacy-aware data practices and examples
- Usage examples with **SmartNoise** (or similar DP tooling where applicable)

### GenAI (AI Foundry / Azure AI Studio-aligned)
- RAG with **Azure AI Search**
- Promptflow / orchestration patterns (where used)
- Fine-tuning patterns for LLMs (where supported/available in your tenant)
- Practical evaluation notes for LLM apps (quality + safety)

### Cheatsheets & learning notes
- ML/LLM metrics cheat sheets + small examples
- Simplified neural network definitions (MLP/CNN/RNN/GAN, etc.)
- ML algorithms explained in “plain English”
- Troubleshooting playbook for common Azure issues
